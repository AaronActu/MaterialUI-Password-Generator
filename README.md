## Quick start
After cloning the repository, you can do `yarn install`.  
Then `yarn start` to start editing or testing the code.

## Production mode
To put the application in production mode, you need to `yarn run build`.
Extract files from the `build` directory being created, and serve theme with a static server (Eg: Apache, Nginx).
